0;2;You there, yes you peasant. Our king, his mighty Edginess, Square the second requires your immediate service. 
1;2;Come with me immediately. As a citizen of of our capital, Hedropolis, you are obliged to serve the cube, I mean crown, at any given time.
2;0;The two of you approach an imposing figure.
3;2;Your squerness, I brought you the fool peas… I mean the genius tactician I have talked of.
4;1;Excellent work my general, you still have a sharp edge to find what we need.
5;1;You, my fair and square servant, I have an important task for you.
6;1;The rebellious, edgeless scum of our Cube kingdom, these smooth brained spheres and cylinders decided to rebel against my square, khm I mean fair rule.
7;1;Your job is simple. Use that pitiful thing, I believe it is called finger, and ensure my safety. 
8;1;I will provide you the strategic map of our defence 
9;1;and my mightiest weapons, the peashooter-cube- tower-2000-mega-giga-destroyer….
10;2;These turrets. 
11;1;Yeah, these mighty weapons. Just place them on the wall and see how our pitiful cornerless, I mean clueless attackers fall.
12;1;Hah, that was much easier than I thought.
13;2;It’s not over, your Squerness. There is more coming this way.
14;1;Prepare the other turrets.
15;2;Sir , we are running low on munition...
16;1;No worries about that, luckily, I know the perfect way to solve it. Gather the corpses of those edgeless idiots…
17;2;You can’t mean…
18;1;Don't forget, we can  improve the turets in the future, if we have the resources.
19;2;Sir! Incoming enemies! Everyone, protect his Edgeness!
